# REST Countries Front-End Project
This is a front-end project that uses the REST Countries API to allow users to search for countries, view details about each country, and filter countries by continent.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine, run *npm i* to install all of the dependencies, and run *npm run dev* to start the application. The application will be loaded and ready to use.

## Usage
Once the application is loaded, users can use the search bar at the top of the page to search for countries. They can also filter countries by continent using the drop-down menu in the sidebar.

When a user clicks on a country from the list of search results, they will be taken to a details page for that country. The details page includes information about the country, such as its population, capital city, and official languages.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using React, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, and the REST Countries API. The following libraries and tools were used:

React-router-dom: to navigate through the different pages

React-bootstrap: to simplify the design by using pre-built components


## Lessons Learned
My primary goal with this project was to strengthen my skillsets with React and Bootstrap. While working on this project, I created a responsive, informative, and user-friendly website.
